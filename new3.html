A while ago I worked for Johnson&Johnson (Hello Dimitris Agrafiotis and the others!) and I had to design some complex dialogs using the .Net WinForms. By default any static or edit-box text was set something like “Tahoma, 10pt”. But I all the time had to worry about some "extra space" in the end of the text line, because when changing the resolution it sometimes didn't fit the given width and used text wrapping. In these cases the forms became totally unusable. So, if you take care of the proportional scaling, you have to design your forms in a very ugly way, keeping a lot of empty space just in case. The other way is to take a hammer, and nail the text size to pixels. Namely, set something like “Tahoma 14px”. It means a lot. It means that your software cannot be used at high resolutions. No matter how well Windows Vista supports text scaling: the bad thing already happened. There is a lot of software that relies on a fixed resolution, which prevents the manufacturers from developing higher resolution displays. There is simply no motivation! Do not blame me, do not blame many other software developers and designers. Blame Microsoft for their brutal text hinting, which results in unpredictable overlapping between text and other graphic elements.

Now, if you type the very same word “institutions” in WordPad, the result will be different and it does look much better. So, why in MS Word it looks worse? — Only because of the visible inaccuracy in positioning. Function TextOut(), that is probably used in WordPad does not care about it, but MS Word has to. I'm not sure, but probably the MS Word developers calculate the glyph advance at a high resolution for “unhinted” glyphs. With the public Win32 API the only way to do that is to call GetGlyphOutline() with a heavily zoomed affine matrix, so that, the resulting glyph would fit 1024x1024 box or something like that. Otherwise the advance value will be inaccurate since it is measured in integral pixels. The direct use of it produces exactly the same result as in TextOut(). It looks good, but accumulates a significant error along the text line (more than the whole symbol position within only one word!).
In the dialog boxes they think it is fair to ignore preserving the text width. Why? — Because otherwise the captions, menus, dialogs, and so on, wouldn't looks so pretty! They would have the very same problem with “randomly distributed kerning”, which would be bad for business. So, nice looking and sharp text in the dialogs is good for business, but it accumulates huge inaccuracy in the text width, which makes it impossible to change the dialog size, which makes software vendors rely on 96 DPI. So, it goes, we have a circulus vitiosus. Eventually it turned into a big profanation.
From the fair engineering point of view there must be some reasonable trade-off between the sharpness and functionality. The problem is Microsoft concentrated on the glamorous look but completely sacrificed the functionality. The paradox is at 300 DPI or more you don't need any hinting at all and any text becomes freely scalable (after 600 DPI you can do without anti-aliasing). But you can't use your software at 300 DPI because it's designed for at most 100 DPI! This is the price the world pays for this glamorous look. The price is too high, just incredibly high.
However, even 5 (five!) years ago it was technically possible to have freely scalable forms and dialogs. All we needed is allow for a certain degree of blurriness, very subtle, not like in Mac OS X. Like in Adobe's products. Windows people do not like Safari for too blurry output. I partially agree with them, except for blind refusing any other ways of rendering but Windows. This “fanboyism” is reckless. It is equivalent to saying “I don't care about the resolution, I just want to have my 96 DPI for ever, with the Windows-style text, and so, I vote for stopping the progress.” Is that clever?
I'm not advocating Apple because I do not like Apple rendering either. To me it really looks too blurry. It looks like they use some kind of a strange auto-hinting that blurs horizontal strokes, but does not offer any advantages. In fact, their hinting looks lousy. It especially looks bad with the sans-serif group of fonts, as if they intentionally shifted sharp text by 0.2…0.5 pixel. This is really why windows people do not like Safari. But at the same time many of them happily use the Adobe Acrobat Reader and do not buzz. It's because the text looks appropriate there (I'm not saying it's perfect, I'm saying it's appropriate to windows fans). And it remains freely scalable! — just load any document and gradually zoom it in/out. The text layout remains fully consistent and has proper kerning at the same time. So, yes, I would vote for the Adobe way of rendering, because their trade-off seems to be very close to the optimum.
